In this project the first thing that is done is to check the watchdog timer to make sure it doesnt get stuck. On the F boards, it requires a line to unlock the GPIO pins. Then the select bits and direction bitsare set to the required value for outputing or inputing. In order to implement the buttons, the pull down and pull up resistors need to be given values to enable them. In the while loop, it checks if the button is pressed by ANDing the P1IN signal with BIT3, which checks the value of the respective bit. Once this is done, it sets the value of P1OUT to turn on the led or turn it off.
