The way that the multi blink code works is first it checks the watchdog clock to make sure it doesn't get stuck. Then it sets the select bits so that it can read to the leds. Then it sets the direction of GPIO pins to be an output. I utilize an unsigned int to count to a certain value to delay one of the LEDs. This allows them to blink at different speeds. In the while loop it toggles one of the LED's value so that it toggles from on to off. It also checks the state of the counter so it can have the other LED blink at a different speed. If the counter isnt 3, then it increments. Then it delays using a command to delay for 1 Million cycles so we can see the LED blink. On the F boards, it requires a line to unlock the GPIO pins.
