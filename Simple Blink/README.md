The way that the simple blink code works is first it checks the watchdog clock to make sure it doesn't get stuck. Then it sets the select bits so that it can read to the led. Then it sets the direction of GPIO pin to be an output. In the while loop it toggles the LED's value so that it toggles from on to off. Then it delays using a command to delay for 1 Million cycles so we can see the LED blink.
